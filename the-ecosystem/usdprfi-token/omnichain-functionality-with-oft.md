# Omnichain Functionality with OFT

**$PRFI** follows the **Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard**, allowing seamless cross-chain transfers without the need for **asset wrapping, middlechains, or liquidity pools**. By leveraging **LayerZeroâ€™s interoperability technology**, $PRFI ensures:

* **Secure and gas-efficient omnichain transfers** across multiple blockchains.
* **Unified liquidity** without fragmentation across networks.
* **Easy integration into omnichain DeFi protocols**, including lending, borrowing, and staking.

This enables **PrimeFi users to interact with $PRFI natively on any supported chain**, enhancing liquidity and accessibility within the **omnichain DeFi landscape**.
