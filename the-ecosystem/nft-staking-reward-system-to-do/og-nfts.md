# OG NFTs

<mark style="color:red;">**Note:**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">Our NFTs are being migrated to a new network. Staking is paused during this migration, but you can still purchase NFTs on Primeport.</mark>

## <mark style="color:purple;">Introduction to OG NFTs</mark>

As a special reward for our earliest supporters, Prime Numbers Labs offered exclusive OG NFTs to participants of our presale. These NFTs were designed to honor and reward those who believed in our project from the beginning, featuring the best possible reward multipliers and a unique status that sets them apart from all other NFTs in our ecosystem.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Claiming the OG NFTs</mark>

To claim an OG NFT, participants had to hold 100% of their $PRNT tokens obtained during the presale until the designated claiming period, which was one week before the regular NFT minting began. As part of the claiming process, participants were required to stake their $PRNT into the OG NFT, instantly increasing its level and value.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Unique Multiplier System</mark>

Unlike standard generative NFTs, the OG NFTs had a multiplier directly linked to the amount of $PRNT staked during the presale. The more $PRNT a participant held, the higher the multiplier, and consequently, the greater the rewards. These NFTs could be further leveled up like regular NFTs, but they began at a higher level due to the initial staking.

### <mark style="color:blue;">A Rare and Valuable Asset</mark>

OG NFTs were minted only once, and no more will ever be created, making them a truly rare and valuable asset within the Prime Numbers ecosystem. They not only serve as a badge of honor for early supporters but also offer substantial rewards, making them a prized possession for any holder.
