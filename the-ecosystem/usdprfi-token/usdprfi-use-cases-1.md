***

### [**1. Stake-to-Earn (NFT Staking)**](https://primestaking.xyz/) **+ Level-Up System**

* Lock your $PRFI **inside your PRFI NFT**.
* The NFT becomes a “vault” that funnels yield from every Prime Numbers product.
* No NFT = no rewards; the staking contract pays only wallets that hold an NFT with staked $PRFI.&#x20;
* Burning or staking additional $PRFI raises your NFT’s **tier**.
* Higher tiers unlock a larger share of the ecosystem revenue pool and future collection drops.

### **2. DAO Governance**

* $PRFI is the **voting token** for every on-chain proposal: fee tweaks, new asset listings, treasury spending, ecosystem grants.
* Snapshot > Timelock flow; the more $PRFI  you hold, the louder your voice.

### **3. PrimeFi Utility**

| Benefit                       | How it works                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Govern PrimeFi parameters** | Vote on LTV changes, new chains, risk settings.                                      |
| **Participation rewards**     | Supply/borrow and earn extra $PRFI emissions.                                        |
| **Tiered analytics**          | Hold/lock $PRFI and unlock pro dashboards, risk simulators and wallet health alerts. |
| **Simulations & insights**    | Access team-built portfolio simulations normally reserved for institutions.          |

### **4. Omnichain Transport**

* $PRFI is an **OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token)** powered by LayerZero, so you can bridge it natively, no wrappers, no liquidity pools. That means a single, unified supply across Ethereum, Base, HyperEVM, Arbitrum and XDC.&#x20;
