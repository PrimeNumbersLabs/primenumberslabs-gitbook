**WHY XDC NETWORK?**

The open-source protocol software uses a Delegated Proof of Stake (XDPoS) consensus mechanism and is compatible with EVM. It enables fast transactions (2000TPS), interoperability, and cybersecurity.

XDC works on interbank solutions and financial services related to Trade Finance, ISO 20022, and R3 Corda.
