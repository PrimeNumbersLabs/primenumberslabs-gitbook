# How to Stake your $PRNT?

## <mark style="color:purple;">Steps to Stake Your PRNT Tokens</mark>

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 1 — Prepare Your Wallet</mark>

Before you start, ensure your PRNT tokens are in the same wallet as your PRNT Staking NFT. You’ll also need a small amount of XDC to cover the gas fees.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 2 — Connect to the Staking Website</mark>

Visit[ staking.primenumbers.xyz](https://staking.primenumbers.xyz) and connect your wallet. Select the ‘PRNT Staking V3’ option at the top. If your NFT isn’t displayed, you may need to migrate it to the new smart contract using the guide provided.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 3 — Stake Your PRNT</mark>

Once your NFT is visible, click on it and select the ‘Stake’ button. Enter the amount of PRNT you want to stake, and approve the transaction through your wallet. Once approved, confirm the staking, and your PRNT will be successfully staked in your NFT.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Step 4 — Verify and Refresh</mark>

After staking, refresh the NFT page to see the updated amount of staked PRNT. You’re now earning rewards!
