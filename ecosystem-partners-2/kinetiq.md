## **About Kinetiq**

\
Kinetiq is a cutting-edge decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on synthetic assets and liquidity expansion. By issuing synthetic staked tokens, Kinetiq allows users to maximize the efficiency of their staked assets while maintaining liquidity and composability across multiple DeFi platforms. The protocol is designed to seamlessly integrate with various ecosystems, offering users enhanced yield opportunities and flexible financial instruments.

Kinetiq leverages smart contract technology to ensure trustless staking and asset management, reducing the risks associated with traditional staking mechanisms. Through its innovative model, Kinetiq plays a key role in expanding liquidity and utility for staked assets within the HyperLiquid and broader DeFi ecosystems.

PrimeFi is currently exploring the integration of Kinetiq’s synthetic staked tokens into its omnichain lending and borrowing protocol. The PrimeFi team has already engaged in discussions with Kinetiq to assess compatibility and ensure a seamless integration process. However, the integration is not yet finalized as Kinetiq’s token, kHYPE, is currently undergoing an audit to guarantee maximum security for users.
