# Token Audit

## Security Audits

Ensuring the security and integrity of the USDâ‚½FI token is our top priority. All core contracts undergo independent external review before mainnet launch and after any significant upgrade.

***

### Methodology

1. **Reputable auditors**\
   We engage leading firms (e.g. QuillAudits) for in-depth code and economic-model reviews.
2. **Two-phase process**
   * _Preliminary report_: identification of vulnerabilities.
   * _Fix & Verify_: engineering fixes and final auditor sign-off.
3. **Transparent disclosure**\
   Public reports are linked below; further details are available in our wider ecosystem audit hub.
