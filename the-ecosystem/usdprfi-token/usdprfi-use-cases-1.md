# $PRFI Use Cases

$PRFI turns every Prime Numbers product into a yield engine, a governance seat and a VIP pass, all at once.

**Why hold $PRFI?**\
Because it is the passport that lets you **earn**, **govern** and **level-up** across the whole Prime Numbers universe.

***

**1. Stake-to-Earn (NFT Staking)**

* Lock your $PRFI **inside your PRFI NFT**.
* The NFT becomes a “vault” that funnels yield from every Prime Numbers product, PrimeFi fees, ecosystem airdrops, partner rewards.
* No NFT = no rewards; the staking contract pays only wallets that hold an NFT with staked $PRFI.&#x20;

**2. Level-Up Your NFT**

* Burning or staking additional $PRFI raises your NFT’s **tier**.
* Higher tiers unlock a larger share of the ecosystem revenue pool and future collection drops.

**3. DAO Governance**

* $PRFI is the **voting token** for every on-chain proposal: fee tweaks, new asset listings, treasury spending, ecosystem grants.
* Snapshot > Timelock flow; the more $PRFI  you hold, the louder your voice.

**4. PrimeFi Utility**

| Benefit                       | How it works                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Govern PrimeFi parameters** | Vote on LTV changes, new chains, risk settings.                                      |
| **Participation rewards**     | Supply/borrow and earn extra $PRFI emissions.                                        |
| **Early-bird loans**          | Pay a small $PRFI fee to tap new loan markets before public launch.                  |
| **Tiered analytics**          | Hold/lock $PRFI and unlock pro dashboards, risk simulators and wallet health alerts. |
| **Simulations & insights**    | Access team-built portfolio simulations normally reserved for institutions.          |

**5. Omnichain Transport**

* $PRFI is an **OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token)** powered by LayerZero, so you can bridge it natively, no wrappers, no liquidity pools. That means a single, unified supply across Ethereum, Base, HyperEVM and XDC.&#x20;

* **Gas sponsorship** for ERC-4337 smart wallets (planned).
