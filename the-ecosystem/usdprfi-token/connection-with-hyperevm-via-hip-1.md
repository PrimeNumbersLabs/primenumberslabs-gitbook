# Connection with HyperEVM via HIP-1

Hyperliquid’s **HIP-1 standard** allows native tokens on **Hyperliquid L1** to **connect seamlessly with OFT-compatible tokens** on **HyperEVM**. This means that **$PRFI can exist as both a HIP-1 token on Hyperliquid L1 and an OFT on HyperEVM**, ensuring:

* **Full interoperability** between the **Layer 1 exchange ecosystem and EVM-based DeFi**.
* **Enhanced accessibility** for PrimeFi users across Hyperliquid’s infrastructure.
* **A frictionless omnichain experience**, expanding $PRFI’s use cases beyond lending and borrowing.
