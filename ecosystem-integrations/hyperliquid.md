## **About Hyperliquid**

Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange that offers traders a seamless experience with top-tier speed, liquidity, and pricing. Built on its proprietary **HyperEVM** blockchain, Hyperliquid achieves remarkable performance, processing up to **200,000 transactions per second** with a latency of just **0.2 seconds**. This custom Layer 1 infrastructure ensures instant finality and eliminates issues like MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), providing a trading environment that rivals centralized exchanges.

The platform supports advanced order types, including TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price), Scale, and Take Profit/Stop Loss, allowing traders to execute sophisticated strategies directly from the TradingView chart. With zero gas fees, maker rebates, and low taker fees, Hyperliquid ensures cost-effective trading. Additionally, traders can leverage up to **50x**, maximizing capital efficiency.

Transparency is a cornerstone of Hyperliquid's design. All trades, funding rates, and liquidations occur on-chain, ensuring a fully auditable and trustless environment. The platform's user-centric approach is evident in its one-click trading feature, eliminating the need for repetitive wallet approvals and streamlining the trading process.

As of now, Hyperliquid boasts a **Total Value Locked (TVL) of $753 million** and daily trading volumes exceeding **$1 billion**, occasionally surpassing the combined volumes of the next three leading perpetual decentralized exchanges. This rapid growth underscores Hyperliquid's position as a formidable player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape.
