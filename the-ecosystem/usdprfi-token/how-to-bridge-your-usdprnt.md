# How to Bridge your $PRNT?

## <mark style="color:purple;">Steps to Bridge Your PRNT Tokens to a Different Network</mark>

Bridging your PRNT tokens allows you to transfer them between networks, such as from Ethereum to the XDC Network. Here's how you can do it:

### <mark style="color:blue;">Method 1 — Wanchain</mark>

1. **Connect Your Wallet:** Visit[ bridge.wanchain.org](https://bridge.wanchain.org) and connect your wallet.
2. **Select Networks:** Choose the network where your PRNT tokens are currently held and the network you want to bridge them to.
3. **Complete the Transaction:** Be aware of the high fee (e.g., 1,800 XDC). Confirm the transaction through your wallet.
4. **Add PRNT to Your Wallet:** If your tokens don’t appear, manually add the token address for the appropriate network (Ethereum or XDC).

### <mark style="color:blue;">Method 2 — Bitrue Exchange</mark>

1. **Deposit PRNT to Bitrue:** Transfer your PRNT tokens from the current network (e.g., XDC) to Bitrue.
2. **Withdraw to the Desired Network:** Withdraw your tokens from Bitrue to the new network (e.g., Ethereum) by selecting the correct network during withdrawal and entering your wallet address.
3. **Fees:** Note the withdrawal fee (e.g., 15 PRNT on Ethereum), which is generally lower than Wanchain.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Considerations</mark>

* **Cost:** Bridging can be expensive, so it’s best to consolidate your tokens to save on fees.
* **Purpose:** Bridge your tokens only if necessary, and ensure you have enough tokens to cover fee
