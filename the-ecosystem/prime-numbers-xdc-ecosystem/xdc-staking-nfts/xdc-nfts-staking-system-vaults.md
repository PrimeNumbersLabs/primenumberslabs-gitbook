# XDC NFTs Staking System - Vaults

## <mark style="color:purple;">**XDC NFT Staking System: Unlocking Powerful Rewards with Ease**</mark>

In this system, the NFT functions as a vault. Users can stake within the NFT, with the rewards being credited to the NFT. Rewards can be withdrawn from the NFT, and the staked amount can also be retrieved from the NFT. We can say that this is a tokenized masternode.

Through this system, we manage to provide significant benefits to XDC holders interested in staking on nodes while eliminating entry barriers:

* Masternode KYC
* 10M XDC tokens
* Hosting Expenses

***

### <mark style="color:blue;">**How does it function?**</mark> <a href="#how-does-it-function" id="how-does-it-function"></a>

Users can stake their XDC tokens through 2 different NFT collections.

1-When users intend to stake, they need to connect to the platform, select the XDC network, and select the staking option.

2- The platform will then scrutinize the user's wallet to determine if they already possess an "XDC NFT" (We will discuss the various types of NFTs later). If the user does not have an NFT, the platform will display the following options:

a) Mint a Vault NFT (Type 1) (Not live)&#x20;

**b) Purchase a Premium Vault NFT (Type 2) (Current XDC NFT staking system)**

{% hint style="success" %}
Premium Vault NFT = XDC NFT Staking System
{% endhint %}

The differentiation between Vault NFT and Premium Vault NFT lies in the following:

#### <mark style="color:blue;">**Vault NFT**</mark>

These NFTs empower users to stake $XDC within the NFT and earn rewards from the blockchain nodes that the user is utilizing. The user can use one of their favorite NFTs by minting a wrap of their NFT with the Prime Numbers Labs Utility!

{% hint style="info" %}
Vaults Mechanisms work with a $10 activation fee in PRFI.

There is no minimum staking amount to receive rewards.
{% endhint %}

#### [**Premium Vault NFT**](https://primeport.xyz/collection/xdc/XDCNFTv2)

These NFTs also allow users to stake within the NFT and receive rewards from the blockchain nodes that the user is employing. Premium NFTs fetch higher rewards compared to Vault NFTs.

{% hint style="info" %}
The minimum staking amount to receive masternode rewards is 100k XDC tokens.
{% endhint %}

3- Once the user possesses an NFT and is connected to the platform, they can commence staking.

4- The user needs to select the NFT, input the staking amount, and they're ready!
