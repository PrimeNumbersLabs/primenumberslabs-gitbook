### **About LayerZero**

LayerZero is an **omnichain interoperability protocol** that enables seamless and secure communication between multiple blockchains. Its innovative technology eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries, providing a decentralized approach to cross-chain asset and data transfers. With its **Ultra Light Nodes (ULN)** infrastructure, LayerZero facilitates efficient cross-chain interactions, reducing costs and enhancing security.

Currently, **LayerZero supports over 70 blockchain networks**, including **Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, and more**. The company has raised **over $260 million** across three funding rounds, backed by top-tier investors such as **Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Coinbase Ventures**. This strong financial and technical backing positions LayerZero as a leading player in the **blockchain interoperability space**, driving the future of cross-chain connectivity.

### **Benefits for PrimeFi**

At **PrimeFi**, integrating **LayerZero** is essential to delivering a truly omnichain experience in our lending and borrowing protocol. The key benefits include:

* **Seamless interoperability:** LayerZero enables asset and data transfers across multiple blockchains without the need for centralized bridges or wrapped tokens.
* **Reduced costs and transaction times:** Its efficient architecture minimizes gas fees and accelerates cross-chain operations within PrimeFi.
* **Enhanced security and trust:** By eliminating dependencies on centralized validators, LayerZero provides a more secure and attack-resistant infrastructure.
* **Our lending and borrowing protocol is truly Omnichain:** Thanks to LayerZero’s technology, **PrimeFi** allows users to manage collateral and loans across multiple blockchains without restrictions, ensuring a smooth and interoperable experience within the DeFi ecosystem.
* **Support for the OFT standard:** The **Prime Numbers Labs token, $PRFI**, utilizes the **Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) Standard**, built on LayerZero. This allows for the transfer of native tokens across blockchains without the need for wrapping or liquidity pools, optimizing interoperability within PrimeFi.
* **Launching PRFI NFTs using the ONFT standard:** At **Prime Numbers Labs**, we are preparing to launch our **PRFI NFTs**, which will utilize the **Omnichain Non-Fungible Token (ONFT) Standard** developed by LayerZero. This will enable NFTs to be transferred natively across different blockchains, eliminating the need for wrapped versions and improving their liquidity and accessibility across multiple networks.

### **Recognitions**

It is worth highlighting that **Daniel de Witte, our CPO, participated in ETHGlobal Brussels in 2024**, where he achieved **2nd place for Best Omnichain Implementation** for LayerZero. This recognition underscores our team's deep expertise in omnichain technology and our commitment to innovation within the space.
