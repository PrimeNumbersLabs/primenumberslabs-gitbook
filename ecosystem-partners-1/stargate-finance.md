**Benefits for PrimeFi**

At **PrimeFi**, integrating **Stargate Finance** allows us to optimize asset mobility across multiple blockchains, enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of our omnichain lending and borrowing protocol. Key benefits include:

* **Seamless asset transfers:** Users can move collateral and loans across different chains without relying on centralized solutions or wrapped tokens.
* **Deep and efficient liquidity:** Stargate provides access to highly optimized cross-chain liquidity pools, reducing fragmentation risk and improving protocol stability.
* **Simplified user experience:** With Stargate, PrimeFi users can manage their assets across multiple blockchains through a smooth and intuitive interface.
* **Support for the OFT Standard:** The **Prime Numbers Labs token, $PRFI**, utilizes the **Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard**, enabling assets to be transferred across multiple blockchains without wrapped tokens, middlechains, or liquidity pools. This ensures more efficient and secure interoperability, eliminating friction in asset mobility within the PrimeFi ecosystem.
